/**
 * What each attacker does to each defender, as a percentage of a **full-health**
 * target. Attacker down the side.
 *
 * ⚠️ **There is no attack stat and no defence stat**, following AW, which has
 * neither: a unit's toughness is not a property of the unit, it is every
 * attacker's column against it. Defence comes from terrain and nowhere else.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A matrix is not a stylistic choice here, it is arithmetic.** Give every
 * unit an attack `A` and a defence `D` and let damage be any `f(A, D)`, and the
 * ordering that falls out is *transitive*: if infantry beats cavalry and cavalry
 * beats artillery, then infantry beats artillery, necessarily. Rock-paper-
 * scissors is non-transitive, so no pair of scalars can express one. The only
 * options are a matrix or a class system, and at three unit types a class system
 * is more machinery than the nine numbers it would save.
 *
 * Nested `Record`s, so adding a `UnitTypeId` turns every incomplete row into a
 * compile error rather than a silent gap -- the property `TERRAIN` and
 * `UNIT_TYPES` already have.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Untuned, but no longer arbitrary.** A first cut ran 40-90 and
 * `scripts/matchups.ts` killed it: everything died in two hits, so terrain
 * became a rounding error, the nine numbers produced two distinct outcomes, and
 * luck moved nothing. It also starved 10a -- a unit went 100 to 45 to dead
 * without ever passing through the health band where a charge is legal.
 *
 * The spread here is taken from AW, whose nine analogous cells (Infantry,
 * Recon, Artillery) run 12 to 90. ⚠️ **The range transfers; the shape must
 * not.** AW's 12 and 15 encode *armour penetration* -- a rifle cannot hurt a
 * vehicle -- and there is no armour in a horse-and-musket war. Importing them
 * would say infantry cannot hurt horses and leave cavalry untouchable.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Cavalry is bad in every column on purpose** -- carbines from horseback.
 * Its identity lives in the charge table (10a), and a cavalry that also shoots
 * well has no reason to close. Six hits to kill infantry is what makes that
 * true rather than merely stated.

/**
 * The widest the luck bonus ever gets, matching AW exactly.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Additive, never multiplicative, and applied last** -- see `computeDamage`,
 * where getting this wrong twice is documented. It makes weak attacks the swingy
 * ones: 9 points on a volley of 18 is +50%, the same 9 on artillery's 67 is
 * +13%. A crippled unit's best roll is most of its remaining threat.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Never negative.** Base AW luck is a bonus only -- "bad luck" belongs to
 * particular COs -- so a table value is a *floor* on what an attack does, not
 * an average it varies around.
 *
 * No rescaling was needed from AW: the 0-9 is already in our units, because
 * `baseDamage` is a percentage in both schemes.
