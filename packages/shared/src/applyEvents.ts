/**
 * The only thing that mutates state.
 *
 * Reducers decide *what happened* and return events; this turns events into a
 * new state. One mutation path, so live play and replay cannot diverge --
 * `applyEvents(initialState, wholeLog)` reproduces `currentState` by
 * construction rather than by hope.
 *
 * Two rules constrain every event, now and later:
 *
 * 1. **Independently applicable.** Each event must make sense against the state
 *    immediately before it, with no knowledge of its siblings. That is what
 *    lets a log be replayed to any point -- including mid-resolution -- and
 *    what lets the client fold as it animates. A successful charge therefore
 *    emits `unitDied` *and* `unitMoved`, not one compound event.
 *
 * 2. **Absolute values, not deltas.** An event says what something *became*,
 *    never how much it changed by. That is what makes applying one twice a
 *    no-op, so at-least-once delivery is safe and a replaying client needs no
 *    exact-once bookkeeping. `unitAttacked` must therefore carry the target's
 *    resulting HP, not the damage dealt -- damage is `before - after`, which
 *    the client already knows because it holds the preceding state.
 *
 * Idempotent is not commutative: order still matters, and comes from
 * `(seq, index within the events array)`.
