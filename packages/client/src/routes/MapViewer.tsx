/**
 * A board, with nobody playing on it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **It builds the real renderer on a real `GameState`**, rather than a
 * lighter terrain-only path of its own. A second way to draw a board is a second
 * thing to keep in step with `composeTerrain`, and it would be the copy nobody
 * notices has gone stale -- this page is looked at rarely and by one person.
 * What it costs is the unit models, which load anyway and are worth seeing here:
 * the deployment is half of what makes a map good or bad.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Nothing is wired for input.** `onTileClick` is never registered, so the
 * canvas orbits and zooms and answers nothing else. That is the whole difference
 * between this and `GameCanvas`, and it is an omission rather than a mode: there
 * is no selection state here to be in.

      {/* ⚠️ **Keyed on the map, so each scene gets its own element.** Babylon
          takes the canvas's WebGL context at construction and gives it up on
          `dispose`; building a second engine on the same element is a context
          that has been handed back and asked for again, which is a black canvas
          on some drivers and fine on others. A fresh element makes it neither.
          ⚠️ Sized in pixels rather than viewport units: the point of this page
          is comparing boards, and a view that fills the window puts the picker
          and the board on separate screens.
          ⚠️ **And roughly square, which is not a taste.** The camera fits the
          board at its worst case over every angle it may be turned to -- see
          `boardRadius` -- so the frustum is sized by the ground-plane
          *half-diagonal* whatever the aspect, and a wide box spends the surplus
          on background. Boards are square, so a square viewport wastes least:
          measured, the board goes from filling 44% of an 880x520 box to 68% of
          this one. */}
