// How hurt a unit is, read at a glance: a ring of ten segments at its base,
// extinguishing as it weakens and absent entirely at full strength.
//
// ⚠️ **Ten segments because the formula reads ten bands.** `computeDamage` uses
// `ceil(health / 10)`, so 91 and 100 fight identically -- a bar drawn from raw
// health would show two different states that behave the same. Ten segments for
// ten bands means the display *cannot* promise precision the rules do not have.
// The exact figure belongs to a selected-unit panel, later.
//
// ⚠️ Segments extinguish rather than dim. Bands are discrete, and a fade would
// imply a continuum that is not there.

// ⚠️ **The rulebook's own count, not a matching constant.** This file used to
// compute `ceil(health / (MAX_HEALTH / SEGMENTS))` with its own `SEGMENTS = 10`,
// which made "one segment per band" a coincidence that held as long as two
// numbers in two packages happened to agree. `band` is what `computeDamage`
// reads, so the display now cannot drift from the arithmetic it describes.
