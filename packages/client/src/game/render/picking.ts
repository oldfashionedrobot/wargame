/**
 * Which tile is under a point on screen.
 *
 * Still plane arithmetic rather than mesh-picking -- tile lookup stays
 * independent of what is actually drawn, and Babylon's picking performance
 * gates stay out of it. What changed is that there is no longer **one** plane.
 *
 * ⚠️ A single plane at `y = 0` is only right for a flat board. Raise a tile and
 * it draws up-screen of where it sits, so a click on a peak lands on the tile
 * *behind* it -- which is why height used to be capped at a quarter of a tile.
 * Instead this tries each distinct surface height the board has, **tallest
 * first**, and takes the first answer that agrees with itself: the tile found
 * at height `h` must actually be a tile whose surface is at `h`. Tallest first
 * is what makes a peak win over the plains it occludes, which is the same order
 * the renderer draws them in.
 *
 * Cheap because a board has two or three distinct heights, not hundreds.
 *
 * Clicking the *side* of a raised tile agrees with nothing -- the cliff face
 * belongs to a surface that is neither its top nor the ground -- so the flat
 * answer is kept as a fallback and returned when no level is consistent. That
 * is exactly what this did before, for every click.
