 * makes it do anything.** Passing `colors` to `CreateLineSystem` turns on
 * vertex colouring, after which `LinesMesh.alpha` is ignored -- the fragment
 * comes from the vertex colour. And vertex *alpha* stays off unless asked for,
 * so until it was asked for, every line drew fully opaque whatever either
 * number said.
 *
 * ⚠️ Which means the tuning this comment used to describe never happened.
 * Near-black at 35%, white at 10%, grey at 7% -- all three rendered identically
 * opaque, and only the RGB was ever really being chosen. Treat the value below
 * as the first one anybody has actually seen.

 * ⚠️ This was briefly a square per tile at each tile's *own* surface, because a

 * longer a case that arises: a mountain is a mesa standing on an ordinary tile,
 * so the **ground is flat everywhere** and only props rise above it. The grid
 * marks the board's floor, and the floor is one plane.
 *
 * Flat also means long spans rather than per-tile outlines, which means every
 * interior edge is drawn **once** instead of by both of its tiles — so the
 * alpha is the alpha, rather than roughly double it over the interior.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the overlays. A hover or range tint sits at
 * `surfaceAt`, which is the top of whatever you would stand on, so hovering a
 * mesa lights the mesa rather than the floor hidden underneath it.
