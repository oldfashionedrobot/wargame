/**
 * Open field with the road up the middle -- the fast way *at* the enemy -- and a
 * rise on one flank of each approach.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The two rises are diagonally opposed**, west on the near approach and
 * east on the far one, so the board is not a mirror and the same plan does not
 * work from both ends. Four stars of cover apiece and shut to `wheels`: a
 * strong position no gun can ever hold, which is what stops either being simply
 * the best place to be.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A wood sits beside the road at the centre**, which is the tile both
 * players actually want. It is the only cover on the board anything can occupy,
 * it overlooks the one fast route, and it is equally far from both -- so it is
 * the first argument of the game rather than a position either side inherits.
